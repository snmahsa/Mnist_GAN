GAN architecture or Generative Adversarial Networks is a neural network architecture that is used to generate new data in virtual form such as images, texts or sounds. This architecture includes two important parts that compete with each other in the education process.

The first part of the GAN architecture, which is called "Generator", is responsible for generating new data. The generator is inspired by a hypothetical distribution, such as a random distribution, and tries to generate data that is similar to the original training data.

The second part of the GAN architecture, called the "Discriminator", is responsible for determining whether the data generated by the generator is real or not. Given a set of original training data and generator-generated data, the discriminator learns to distinguish between them.

The training of the GAN architecture is done through two parallel paths: the generator improves its ability to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator improves its ability to discriminate between real and generated data. This competition between the generator and the discriminator leads to an equilibrium point that allows the generation of new data that are hard to distinguish from the original data.

GAN architecture is used in various fields such as generating images, videos, texts and music. This technique is one of the powerful methods in producing creative and innovative content and has achieved real and quality results.
